# Geant4 Simulation for the EIC Light Guides

Program evaluates the best length of a lightguide required to obtain maximum light yield from a scintillation-based detector. These studies are rested by the EIC barrel calorimeter engineering group (Rolf Ent, Elke Aschenauer).

## Key Geometry Features

* Trapezoidal scintillation crystals. SciGlass material, size 4×4 → 6×6 cm. Length is 40 cm.
* Trapezoidal light guides made from PMMA material.
* Crystal and light guide are wrapped in 65 micron ESR reflector.
* Sensitive detector part is 6x6 array of S13360_6025CS SiPMs with silicone resin window.
